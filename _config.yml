  # Settings for sharing helper. 
  # Sharing is for things like tweet, plusone, like, reddit buttons etc.
  # Set 'provider' to the sharing provider you want to use.
  # Set 'provider' to false to turn sharing off globally.

  # Settings for all other include helpers can be defined by creating 
  # a hash with key named for the given helper. ex:
  #
  #   pages_list :
  #     provider : "custom"   
  #
  # Setting any helper's provider to 'custom' will bypass the helper code
  # and include your custom code. Your custom file must be defined at:
  #   ./_includes/custom/[HELPER]
  # where [HELPER] is the name of the helper you are overriding.
